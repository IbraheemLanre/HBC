          <p>
            I am presently in a training program at Helsinki Business College
            where I am studying to become a full software developer. I am taking
            these classes to sharpening my reasoning and logical thinking as a
            software developer and also to understand what the customer wants as
            an engineer. The program is really exciting, I hope I am able to see
            it through till the end.
