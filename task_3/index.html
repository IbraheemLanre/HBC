        </h4>
        <p>( <em>from</em> Hamlet, <em>spoken by Hamlet</em> )</p>
        <p>
          To be, or not to be: that is the question:<br />
          Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer <br />
          The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, <br />
          Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, <br />
          And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep; <br />
          No more; and by a sleep to say we end <br />
          The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks <br />
          That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation <br />
          Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep; <br />
          To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub; <br />
          For in that sleep of death what dreams may come <br />
          When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, <br />
          Must give us pause: there's the respect <br />
          That makes calamity of so long life; <br />
          For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, <br />
          The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, <br />
          The pangs of despised love, the law's delay, <br />
          The insolence of office and the spurns <br />
          That patient merit of the unworthy takes, <br />
          When he himself might his quietus make <br />
          With a bare bodkin? <br />
          who would fardels bear, To grunt and <br />
          sweat under a weary life, But that the <br />
          dread of something after death, The <br />
          undiscover'd country from whose bourn <br />
          No traveller returns, puzzles the will <br />
          And makes us rather bear those ills we <br />
          have Than fly to others that we know not of? <br />
          Thus conscience does make cowards of us <br />
          all; And thus the native hue of resolution <br />
          Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, <br />
          And enterprises of great pith and moment With <br />
          this regard their currents turn awry, And lose <br />
          the name of action.--Soft you now! The fair Ophelia! <br />
          Nymph, in thy orisons Be all my sins remember'd!‚Äù
